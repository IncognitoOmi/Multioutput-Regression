# Multioutput Regression using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project implements multioutput regression using linear regression techniques. Multioutput regression is used when you need to predict multiple continuous target variables simultaneously.

## Features
- Implements multioutput regression using scikit-learn's `MultiOutputRegressor` with linear regression as the base estimator.
- Evaluates the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics.
- Provides an example of how to train and evaluate the model using sample data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: scikit-learn, numpy, pandas

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd project-directory
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Example Code
```Libraries
from sklearn.multioutput import MultiOutputRegressor
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
## Data Format
- **Input Features**: Describe the format and structure of the input features used for training and prediction.
- **Output/Target Variables**: Explain the format of the target variables for multioutput regression.

## Training
Explain how to train the multioutput regression model using your implementation.

## Evaluation
Describe how to evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Example
Provide a complete example demonstrating the end-to-end usage of your project:
- Loading data
- Preprocessing (if applicable)
